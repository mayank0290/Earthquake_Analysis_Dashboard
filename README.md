## SEISMIC PATTERNS

Total Number of Earthquakes by Magnitude 🌍📊: This insight shows the distribution of earthquakes based on their magnitude. It helps identify the frequency of small, moderate, and large earthquakes.

Total Number of Earthquakes by Months 🗓️📊: This insight displays how earthquake occurrence varies across different months. It can reveal seasonal patterns or anomalies.

Total Number of Earthquakes by Year 📅📊: This insight provides an overview of earthquake trends over time. It helps track changes in seismic activity year by year.

Depth and Magnitude Relationship 🔍📏: This insight explores the correlation between earthquake depth and magnitude. It can reveal interesting patterns or outliers.

Depth Histogram 📊🔍: The depth histogram visualizes the distribution of earthquake depths. It helps understand where most earthquakes occur within the Earth’s crust.

Total Earthquakes by Places 🌎📊: This insight shows the geographical distribution of earthquakes. It highlights regions with higher seismic activity.
